 = Apache Access Log to CSV Converter =
 ======================================

Takes an Apache log of the form:

123.45.67.890 - - [23/Sep/2011:12:13:32 -0400] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 2279 "http://www.some-referrer.com/referral-page/" "Some User Agent 1.0.1"

and converts it to:

"IP","Time","Request_Type","Path","Response","Referral_Domain","Referral_Path","User_Agent"
"123.45.67.890","2011-09-23 12:13:32","GET","/","200","http://www.some-referrer.com/","/referral-page/","Some User Agent 1.0.1"

Note that this was developed for my logs, so if yours are in a different format
you'll have to tweak the regular expressions. Hey, at least it's a start for you :)
